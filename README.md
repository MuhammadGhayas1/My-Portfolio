Interactive-Portfolio by Muhammad Ghayas

A Responsive and Attractive Portfolio for Developers 🚀
This is a clean, beautiful, and fully responsive portfolio template designed using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to keep it simple while delivering a sleek look. I plan to add JavaScript for animations and interactivity.
